# SalesForecasting

This is a small Python data science project that predicts daily sales demand for retail stores using store attributes, promotions, and holiday information.
The example uses synthetic data to simulate real-world scenarios and demonstrate a forecasting workflow.

📌 Project Overview

Retailers need to anticipate product demand to manage inventory, staffing, and promotions effectively.
This project builds a simple linear regression model that forecasts the number of units sold per day, helping store managers make informed decisions.

The workflow includes:

Generating synthetic sales data for multiple stores

Encoding categorical features (day of week)

Training and evaluating a predictive model

Visualizing actual vs. predicted sales

Forecasting demand for new store scenarios

🔧 Features

Creates a synthetic dataset of sales demand

Implements Linear Regression using scikit-learn

Evaluates model accuracy using Mean Absolute Error

Produces visualizations for model performance

Makes predictions for new store-day scenarios
